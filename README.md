# 🏅 Olympics Data Analysis (1976–2008)

A data analysis and machine learning project using historical Summer Olympics data from 1976 to 2008.  
This project explores medal trends across gender, countries, and sports, and builds a predictive model for medal classification.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze Olympic medal data to uncover insights by gender, sport, year, and country.
- Visualize patterns using Python libraries.
- Predict the medal type (Gold/Silver/Bronze) using logistic regression.
